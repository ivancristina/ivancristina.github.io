Hi, I am **Ivan Cristina**, but Ivan's enough. I'm currently a **Simulator Technician** at *CAE* (and previously Ryanair), and <span title="I know it is Macaronic Latin, but even Cicero used it">"in secundis"</span> a (self-declared) developer and designer.

Graduated in Transportation and Logistics specialized in Aeronautics at ITAER "Arturo Ferrarin" in Catania, I also studied at the Catania's Aeroclub as Private Pilot Student.

I love learning new languages. In addition to **Italian**, I speak **English**, **Spanish** and that little bit of **French** that I have not yet forgotten.
Between work and private life, every now and then I have to learn some programming. Nothing exceptional, but just enough to be able to combine something in:
- C, C#, Objective-C
- ASP, ASP.net
- VBS
- Java
- HTML, Markdown
- CSS, Javascript
- Work proprietaries

I also know a little about Swift and Kotlin, and often start new projects to test myself. You can maybe find some of them useful: in that case feel free to check my [Github](https://github.com/ivancristina/).
