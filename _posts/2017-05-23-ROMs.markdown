# Hey there.

![java-javascript](/img/in-post/post-js-version/Team.png)

Since the very end of December 2016, I started to build ROMs for the S4 Active (GT-I9295 or jactivelte). It was difficult at the beginning, but when you're into it... Well, it's still complicated, but at least now I understand something like the 1% of what I effectively do during the process.

Everything started with the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=70261434&postcount=323" target="_blank">release of the nougat sources</a> by the dear user <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=7008679" target="_blank">@pchatzop</a>. And even if I was (and I still am) noob as fuck, I dualbooted a distro of Ubuntu 16.04 into my old laptop, and after a lot of work, sleepless nights and an HUGE help from various guys, I finally managed to build a very special ROM for me, the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4/i9505-orig-develop/jdcteam-optimized-cyanogenmod-14-0-t3479888" target="_blank">Optimized LineageOS</a> (or Optimized Cyanogenmod 14.1, before the death of cyano - RIP), by the <a href="https://github.com/JDCTeam" target="_blank">JDCTeam</a>.
Then I decided to move to something cleaner, so I started to build stock LineageOS, and opened a specific xda DEVDB Project. You could get it a shot at my <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4-active/development/7-1-1-optimized-cyanogenmod-14-1-t3528753" target="_blank">LOS thread</a>.

Here I met another special guy, <a href="https://github.com/tsvietOK" target="_blank">Vladyslav Tsvietkov</a>, or just Vlad (cause I'll never remember his full name, my bad), a person as kind as prodigious, a real beast. Thanks to him almost every bugs have been fixed, giving the ROM an incredible stability, considering we're talking about Android Nougat 7.1.1 into a 4 years old device (with a still respectable hardware, though).
Of course a laptop wasn't sufficient to build , considering each build took me about 6 hours, and here comes <a href="https://github.com/zagi988" target="_blank">Bruno Negovec</a>, a croat motherfucker with a lot of money to spend in PCs, so much he was so kind to give me the remote access to an Ubuntu VM in his powerful monster.

So now, with a fucking good internet speed (of course Bruno's) and a pretty nice server, it was time for some fresh air. What about Resurrection RemixOS?
And there it goes, new ROM, new <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4-active/development/7-1-1-rr-5-8-0-t3541969" target="_blank">RR thread</a> and new donators. Yep, donators. Cause some amazing guys even donated me money, like in the case of <a href="https://github.com/olooikea" target="_blank">Viatcheslav Ivanov</a>, who donated me a 1TB Western Digital Blue HDD, or again Joachim Wanke (1,62 USD), Martin MÃ¼ller (9,31 USD) and Krystian Herman (5,47 USD).

Thanks to all these superguys you can now enjoy our builds, located at <a href="https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=141424my" target="_blank">my Android File Host</a>, or at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx-MjaVCl0SsV3R2enJqSkpKVUU" target="_blank">Vlad's Google Drive</a>.

## Wanna build?

No problem! I made a <a href="https://ivancristina.github.io/HowToBuildivancristina.itbproof guide about how to compile LOS/based 14.1 ROMs</a> for our friend the S4 Active. You cannot make mistakes, every single step is guided, so even a noob like me shouldn't go wrong. (Yeah, I said shouldn't, cause the compiling world is a thunderstorm of errors of every genre, from wrong local_manifests to ninja/jack errors)

So... have a nice day and happy building!
