## Well. I did it

After hours of nerding, I finally managed to get this crap working. Dunno completely why, but I did.
Huge thanks to [Hux](https://github.com/Huxpro) for his incredibly well-made base. Without him I'd probably still trying to mess with html syntax.
Anyway, I don't think there's a lot more to say, so hope you all the best my friend, cause if you're here there's something wrong in you.

# Content

Oh, I almost forgot. I opened this blog in order to publish rubbish about my "projects", so if you're in search of something intresting here, you could go away.
