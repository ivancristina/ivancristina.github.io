Hi, I am **Ivan Cristina**, but Ivan's enough. I'm currently a **simulator engineer** at *CAE* (and previously RyanAir), developer and designer.

Graduated in Transportation and Logistics specialized in Aeronautics at ITAER "Arturo Ferrarin" in Catania. Studied at the Aeroclub in Catania, as Private Pilot Student and currently full-time working and attending IT University in Varese (Italy).

I love learning whatever kind of language and I usually started many projects in order to test myself. You can maybe find some of them useful: in that case feel free to check my [Github](https://github.com/ivancristina/).
