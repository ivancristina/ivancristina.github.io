Hi, I am **Ivan Cristina**, you can call me ***Ivan*** (funny level 99999,99%). I'm a *"software engineer"*,  a designer & a kept man. If you're visiting this site, I bet you just lost yourself into the web or you're a sad person.

Currently attending the ITAER "Arturo Ferrarin" in Catania, as part of the 5ªC. Also studying at the Aeroclub in Catania, as Private Pilot Student.

Sometimes I work on rubbish. You could see some useless, unfinished or failed project in my [Github](https://github.com/ivancristina/).

I poorly try to do something in my life, and sometimes I manage to get something work. Probably not this site.
