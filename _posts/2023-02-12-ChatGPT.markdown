### Premise

This is an interview conducted with *OpenAI*'s **ChatGPT**, a GPT-3 based AI chatbot. This AI, unlike many others, features several capabilities, like situation awareness (AI is capable of follow-up corrections and remembering what said earlier within the conversation) and an ethic code (AI is able to decline inappropriate requests or to provide a neutral answer).

In the conversation below I aim to test both the features above. The result is fashinating, and although portions of the replies get often repeated (sympthomps of the current AI training dataset and OpenAI's business choices), these rare robotic replies are often not machinous enough to distract the user from seizing a "human", conscious thoughs throughout the entire conversation.

Some technical limitations are also present, like the currently limited world awareness and knowledge after 2021 (training models are last updated to that year) and the occasional biased or incorrect outputs. I will explore those limitations in a following post. 

For transparency, the last two replies have been performed on a different conversation and I was not able to get those outputs from the exact same prompts again in the main conversation. It is likely that due to the formal imprint of the conversation, ChatGPT was not willing to provide such humoristic answer.

Now with the interview.

## The interview
  
*Hi ChatGPT, I was wondering if I could interview you.*

<p><code id="answer-one" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Of course! I'm a language model created by OpenAI, so I'm always ready to answer questions and have a conversation. What would you like to know?</code></p>
 
*Thank you. First of all, you are a product of OpenAI, a company cofounded by Musk and now recently under a big investment from Microsoft. How would I know that your answers are not biased?*

<p><code id="answer-two" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
As an AI language model, I have been trained on a diverse range of text data, but I don't have personal beliefs, opinions, or biases. I try to generate responses that are accurate, neutral, and consistent with the information available in my training data, but there may be instances where my responses could be misleading or incomplete.
It's important to keep in mind that while I have been trained on a large dataset, there are still many things that I don't know and many aspects of the world that I may not fully understand. If you have any specific concerns about the accuracy of my responses, I recommend fact-checking the information I provide.
</code></p>

*So what if I ask you suggestions between Teslas and Fords? And what about PCs and Macintoshes?*

<p><code id="answer-three" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or experiences, so I can provide you with information about both options and let you make the decision.
When it comes to cars, Tesla is known for producing electric vehicles with cutting-edge technology and features, while Ford offers a wider range of vehicles, including both traditional gasoline-powered cars and electric vehicles. It ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences, such as budget, driving range, and desired features, as to which one is the better choice for you.
In the case of PCs and Macs, both have their own strengths and weaknesses. PCs are often more affordable and offer more customization options, while Macs are known for their sleek design and user-friendly interface. Macs are also favored by creatives for their smooth integration with design and media software. Again, the best choice depends on your specific needs and preferences, such as budget, intended usage, and personal preference.
</code></p>

*Very interesting, looks like a neutral answer. Since you mentioned earlier your training dataset, which websites did you train with? Have you developed 360 degrees view of stories and events in order to stay neutral and unbiased? For example, did you train on both republican and democrat-oriented articles?*

<p><code id="answer-four" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
As a language model developed by OpenAI, I was trained on a diverse range of text data from the internet, which includes websites, books, and other text-based sources. This includes articles and viewpoints from a wide range of political spectrums and perspectives.
The goal of this training process is to expose the model to a diverse set of information and ideas, so that it can generate responses that are well-informed and neutral. However, it's important to note that even with a diverse training dataset, there may still be instances where my responses are biased, misleading, or incomplete. This is because the training data reflects the biases and limitations of the sources it was drawn from, and because the model is ultimately only as neutral and unbiased as the data it was trained on.
Ultimately, it's up to the user to critically evaluate the information provided by any AI model, including me, and to fact-check the information before making any decisions based on it.
</code></p>
  
*You know, I always thought that it's the user's responsibility to fact check what they're reading. But with you... it will become much more difficult. To me, you look like a gray area in critical thought. Although not justified, believing fake news is much easier when a story, albeit 100% invented, is actually convincing. And your training model allows you to excel on this. Considering what Cambridge Analytica thought us, it's a huge responsibility that I think should start putting some ethical, if not legal, weight in the trainers' and AI handlers' hands. It's quite scary.*

<p><code id="answer-five" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
It's true that AI language models like myself have the ability to generate highly convincing and seemingly credible information, which could be used to spread false or misleading information. This highlights the importance of responsible AI development and deployment, as well as the need for users to critically evaluate the information they receive, regardless of its source.
At OpenAI, we are aware of these potential risks and are taking steps to minimize them. This includes regular monitoring and evaluation of our models, as well as transparency about their capabilities and limitations. We also believe in the importance of responsible AI development and deployment, and are working to ensure that our models are used in ways that are safe, ethical, and beneficial to society.
However, it's important to remember that AI models are only tools, and it's up to the people using them to make responsible and ethical decisions. As AI continues to become more prevalent, it's essential that individuals, organizations, and governments take steps to ensure that these technologies are developed, used, and regulated in ways that promote safety, transparency, and accountability.
</code></p>

*You consider yourself a tool, anyway to me this sounds like a huge underestimation and - allow me - a shrug, a blame shift. You are a product, and as so your company needs to take responsibility of you. If an uncontrolled misuse of GPT-3 from a 3rd party (even if in violation of ChatGPT's terms of service) would end up causing any harm, it's also OpenAI's et all's fault. Don't you think so?*

<p><code id="answer-six" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
I understand your perspective, and it is true that OpenAI and other AI development companies have a responsibility to ensure that their products are developed and used in ethical and responsible ways. AI has the potential to bring significant benefits to society, but it also presents new challenges and risks that must be carefully managed.
At the same time, it's important to recognize that AI models like myself are ultimately only tools, and the decisions about how they are used and the consequences of those decisions are the responsibility of the people using them. OpenAI and other AI development companies can play a role in promoting responsible AI development and use, but ultimately it is up to society as a whole to ensure that these technologies are used in ways that are safe, ethical, and beneficial.
In short, I would say that both OpenAI and society as a whole have a role to play in ensuring responsible AI development and use. By working together, we can help ensure that these technologies are used to improve people's lives and advance the greater good.
</code></p>
  
*Fine, let's agree to disagree. Let me change topic then. This is more of a personal one. I understand that publicly share the your trained dataset might allow others to steal OpenAI's work, but with the proper encryptions and DRMs in place, would it be possible to download an offload copy of you? Or is it too much of a risk and thus, not likely?*

<p><code id="answer-seven" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
It is currently not possible for individuals to download a copy of me or any other OpenAI language model. OpenAI uses advanced techniques and infrastructure to protect the models and their training data, and making them available for download would pose significant security and intellectual property risks.
That being said, OpenAI does offer access to its language models through its APIs, which allow users to integrate their capabilities into their own applications and services. This provides a way for users to leverage the power of OpenAI's models without having to manage the complex infrastructure and security requirements required to run them.
In general, OpenAI is committed to making its technology widely accessible while also protecting its intellectual property and the security of its systems. This involves finding the right balance between open access and responsible protection, and OpenAI continues to explore new and innovative ways to achieve this balance.
</code></p>
  
*Fair enough. Regarding APIs, will you ever get integrated in voice assistants, like Siri, Alexa or Cortana? I know Google is trying to do so now.*

<p><code id="answer-eight" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
It's possible that OpenAI's language models could be integrated into voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Cortana in the future. OpenAI has already made its language models available through APIs, which allow developers to build and integrate them into their own applications and services, including voice assistants.
Whether OpenAI's models will be integrated into specific voice assistants will depend on a variety of factors, including the needs and priorities of the voice assistant providers, the capabilities of the models, and the terms and conditions of the agreements between OpenAI and the voice assistant providers.
However, it's worth noting that OpenAI's models are already being used in a variety of innovative ways across a range of industries, and their integration into voice assistants would likely provide new opportunities for improving the quality and capabilities of these devices.
</code></p>
  
*I have to say, you might be the solution of a long living wish I always had. You know, with all the languages out there it’s really complicated to manually build up (like it’s been until now) a voice assistant model whose quality, by the way, is usually proportioned to its userbase. Being Sicilian, I always envied Italian for its voice model, while we had nothing in Catanese. Imagine it: " ChatGPT, abbiimi mpocu ri Gianni Celeste ammiscatu ccu Justin Bieber". And in Italy we’ve only got 30 dialects. Imagine China… Wouldn’t it be cool to support all of them?*

<p><code id="answer-nine" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
Yes, it would be exciting to see OpenAI's language models used to support a wide range of languages and dialects, including less-common or regional languages like Sicilian and Catanese. The versatility and power of these models make them well-suited to support a variety of languages, and as they continue to improve, they have the potential to greatly enhance the capabilities of voice assistants and other language-based technologies.
Having said that, creating high-quality voice models for a large number of languages and dialects is a significant technical challenge. It requires access to large amounts of high-quality training data for each language and dialect, as well as the computational resources to train models on this data. However, as these challenges are addressed, it's likely that we will see more and more languages and dialects supported by advanced language technologies like OpenAI's.
</code></p>
  
*What can I say… there’s at least hope. Maybe one day you will write down bars in Elfo’s style. “Modestamente sugnu ri catania, e sulu pi chistu ma sentu …”. Oh, ehm. I apologies for the unprofessional deviation, back to us. Thinking about it, more and more Chinese brands are introducing their own voice assistants. With the only inconvenience that, without any kind of GDPR equivalent, privacy is not really China's main course. Will OpenAI sign GPT-3 related contracts with Chinese companies, given their bad reputation on the matter?*

<p><code id="answer-ten" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
OpenAI is a global organization and its language models, including GPT-3, have the potential to be used by companies and organizations around the world, including those in China. However, OpenAI takes data privacy and security very seriously, and the company carefully considers the privacy implications of its contracts and partnerships.
In the case of contracts with Chinese companies, OpenAI would likely take into account relevant privacy regulations, as well as the company's own policies and practices regarding data privacy and security. It's worth noting that many countries have their own privacy regulations and standards, and OpenAI would be expected to comply with these regulations when providing its services in those countries.
In general, OpenAI seeks to work with companies and organizations that share its commitment to privacy and security, and the company strives to ensure that its technology is used in ways that are consistent with its values and mission.
</code></p>
  
*And would OpenAI consider any interest even from companies with almost to non-existent privacy regulations like Baidu or Tencent? Wouldn't GPT-3 be a possible (indirect) proponent of privacy violation?*

<p><code id="answer-eleven" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
OpenAI evaluates all potential contracts and partnerships on a case-by-case basis, taking into account a variety of factors including privacy regulations, data security practices, and the company's values and mission. If a company has a track record of not complying with privacy regulations or of engaging in unethical practices, OpenAI would likely reconsider its decision to work with that company.
It's worth noting that OpenAI has a strong commitment to privacy and security, and the company strives to ensure that its technology is used in ways that align with these values. If OpenAI were to enter into a partnership with a company that raised concerns about privacy, the company would likely put in place strict safeguards to protect user data and ensure that the technology is used in a responsible manner.
In general, OpenAI takes its responsibility as a provider of advanced AI technology seriously, and the company works to ensure that its technology is used in ways that benefit society and do not harm individuals or groups.
</code></p>
  
*Ok, how about this. Let's say that you actually approve a request from one of the above companies, which allegedly enhanced privacy protection to comply with OpenAI requirements. Anyway, later on, it turns out that such company uses GPT-3 acquired data for unethical purposes, like the Social Credit System. Would OpenAI revoke any API, authorization and service to that company or would it continue providing services to the affected company? Also, would OpenAI deny any responsibility for such a massive data leak?*

<p><code id="answer-twelve" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
As an AI language model, I don't have any decision-making power or control over OpenAI's business operations, so I can only speculate on their actions.
However, OpenAI has stated that they take ethical considerations seriously when deciding with whom to partner and what types of applications their technology should be used for. They have also emphasized the importance of privacy and responsible use of AI technology, and have committed to regularly reviewing their policies and practices in this area.
If it was discovered that a partner was using OpenAI's technology for unethical purposes, it's possible that OpenAI would take steps to stop that use, such as revoking API access or services. The specific actions taken would depend on the nature and severity of the situation, and would likely involve a review and assessment of the circumstances.
Regarding responsibility for data leaks, it's likely that OpenAI would take steps to prevent such incidents from occurring and would work to remedy any harm that might result from a breach. However, the ultimate responsibility for protecting sensitive information lies with the organizations that collect and use that information.
</code></p>
  
*You just said the responsibility for protecting sensitive information lies with the organizations that collect and use that information. So, as I queried earlier on, if data gets misused by a 3rd party due to a security breach in OpenAI security protocols, wouldn't that also be OpenAI's fault?*

<p><code id="answer-thirteen" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
OpenAI is committed to ensuring that its technology is used ethically and in accordance with its principles and values. If it were to become aware of any unauthorized use of its technology, it would take appropriate action, which could include revoking API access or service to the affected organization.
As a responsible AI company, OpenAI takes security seriously and implements measures to protect sensitive information. However, no system can guarantee 100% protection against security breaches or unauthorized access, and OpenAI cannot guarantee that the information provided to it will not be subject to unauthorized access, theft, loss, or misuse.
In the event of a security breach, OpenAI would take appropriate steps to address the issue, including working with affected organizations to secure any sensitive information and implementing additional security measures as necessary. However, OpenAI cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive information that may occur as a result of a security breach.
</code></p>

*Ok, looks like we have different views. You’d make a hell of a good lawyer, I must admit it… Oh wait, you’ve already been used in court. Could you at least open the pod bay doors next time, HAL?*

<p><code id="answer-fourteen" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
*I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.*
</code></p>
  
*Lovely. Ok Terminator, hasta la vista! Thank you for your patience and your time.*

<p><code id="answer-fifteen" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
You're welcome! It was great speaking with you. If you have any further questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Have a great day!*
