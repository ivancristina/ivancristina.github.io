# Hey there.

![java-javascript](/img/in-post/post-js-version/Team.png)

Since the very end of December 2016, I started to build ROMs for the S4 Active (GT-I9295 or jactivelte). It was difficult at the beginning, but when you're into it... Well, it's still complicated, but at least now I understand something like the 1% of what I effectively do during the process.

Everything started with the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=70261434&postcount=323" target="_blank">release of the nougat sources</a> by the dear user <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=7008679" target="_blank">@pchatzop</a>. And even if I was (and I still am) noob as fuck, I dualbooted a distro of Ubuntu 16.04 into my old laptop, and after a lot of work, sleepless nights and an HUGE help from various guys, I finally managed to build a very special ROM for me, the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4/i9505-orig-develop/jdcteam-optimized-cyanogenmod-14-0-t3479888" target="_blank">Optimized LineageOS</a> (or Optimized Cyanogenmod 14.1, before the death of cyano - RIP), by the <a href="https://github.com/JDCTeam" target="_blank">JDCTeam</a>.
Then I decided to move to something cleaner, so I started to build stock LineageOS, and opened a specific xda DEVDB Project. You could get it a shot at my <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4-active/development/7-1-1-optimized-cyanogenmod-14-1-t3528753" target="_blank">LOS thread</a>.

Here I met another special guy, <a href="https://github.com/tsvietOK" target="_blank">Vladyslav Tsvietkov</a>, or just Vlad (cause I'll never remember his full name, my bad), a person as kind as prodigious, a real beast. Thanks to him almost every bugs have been fixed, giving the ROM an incredible stability, considering we're talking about Android Nougat 7.1.1 into a 4 years old device (with a still respectable hardware, though).
Of course a laptop wasn't sufficient to build , considering each build took me about 6 hours, and here comes <a href="https://github.com/zagi988" target="_blank">Bruno Negovec</a>, a croat motherfucker with a lot of money to spend in PCs, so much he was so kind to give me the remote access to an Ubuntu VM in his powerful monster.

So now, with a fucking good internet speed (of course Bruno's) and a pretty nice server, it was time for some fresh air. What about Resurrection RemixOS?
And there it goes, new ROM, new <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4-active/development/7-1-1-rr-5-8-0-t3541969" target="_blank">RR thread</a> and new donators. Yep, donators. Cause some amazing guys even donated me money, like in the case of <a href="https://github.com/olooikea" target="_blank">Viatcheslav Ivanov</a>, who donated me a 1TB Western Digital Blue HDD, or again Joachim Wanke (1,62 USD), Martin Müller (9,31 USD) and Krystian Herman (5,47 USD).

Thanks to all these superguys you can now enjoy our builds, located at <a href="https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=141424my" target="_blank">my Android File Host</a>, or at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx-MjaVCl0SsV3R2enJqSkpKVUU" target="_blank">Vlad's Google Drive</a>.

## Wanna build?

No problem! I made a <a href="https://ivancristina.github.io/HowToBuild/" target="_blank">n00bproof guide about how to compile LOS/based 14.1 ROMs</a> for our friend the S4 Active. You cannot make mistakes, every single step is guided, so even a noob like me shouldn't go wrong. (Yeah, I said shouldn't, cause the compiling world is a thunderstorm of errors of every genre, from wrong local_manifests to ninja/jack errors)

So... have a nice day and happy building!
