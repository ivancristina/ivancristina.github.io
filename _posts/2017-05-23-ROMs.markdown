# Hey there.

![java-javascript](/img/in-post/Team.png)

Since the very end of December 2016, I started to build ROMs for the S4 Active (GT-I9295 or jactivelte). It was difficult at the beginning, but when you're into it... Well, it's still complicated, but at least now I understand something like the 1% of what I effectively do during the process.

Everything started with the [release of the nougat sources](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=70261434&postcount=323) by the dear user [@pchatzop](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=7008679). And even if I was (and I still am) noob as fuck, I dualbooted a distro of Ubuntu 16.04 into my old laptop, and after a lot of work, sleepless nights and an HUGE help from various guys, I finally managed to build a very special ROM for me, the [Optimized LineageOS](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4/i9505-orig-develop/jdcteam-optimized-cyanogenmod-14-0-t3479888) (or Optimized Cyanogenmod 14.1, before the death of cyano - _RIP_), by the [JDCTeam](https://github.com/JDCTeam).
Then I decided to move to something cleaner, so I started to build stock LineageOS, and opened a specific xda DEVDB Project. You could get it a shot at my [LOS thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4-active/development/7-1-1-optimized-cyanogenmod-14-1-t3528753).

Here I met another special guy, [Vladyslav Tsvietkov](https://github.com/tsvietOK), or just Vlad (cause I'll never remember his full name, my bad), a person as kind as prodigious, a real beast. Thanks to him almost every bugs have been fixed, giving the ROM an incredible stability, considering we're talking about Android Nougat 7.1.1 into a 4 years old device (with a still respectable hardware, though).
Of course a laptop wasn't sufficient to build, considering each build took me about 6 hours, and here comes [Bruno Negovec](https://github.com/zagi988), a croat motherfucker with a lot of money to spend in PCs, so much he was so kind to give me the remote access to an Ubuntu VM in his powerful monster.

So now, with a fucking good internet speed (of course Bruno's) and a pretty nice server, it was time for some fresh air. What about Resurrection RemixOS?
And there it goes, new ROM, new [RR thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4-active/development/7-1-1-rr-5-8-0-t3541969) and new donators. Yep, donators. Cause some amazing guys even donated me money, like in the case of [Viatcheslav Ivanov](https://github.com/olooikea), who donated me a 1TB Western Digital Blue HDD, or again Joachim Wanke (1,62 USD), Martin MÃ¼ller (9,31 USD) and Krystian Herman (5,47 USD).

Thanks to all these superguys you can now enjoy our builds, located at [my Android File Host](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=141424my), or at [Vlad's Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx-MjaVCl0SsV3R2enJqSkpKVUU).

## Wanna build?

No problem! I wrote a [noobproof guide about how to compile LOS/based 14.1 ROMs](/HowToBuild) for our friend the S4 Active. You cannot make mistakes, every single step is guided, so even a noob like me shouldn't go wrong. (Yeah, I said shouldn't, cause the compiling world is a thunderstorm of errors of every genre, from wrong local_manifests to ninja/jack errors)

So... have a nice day and happy building!
